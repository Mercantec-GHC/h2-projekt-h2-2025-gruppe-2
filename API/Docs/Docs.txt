UserId got added to BookingRooms table. Hypo: Since we ran the migrations with users, bookings and rooms before
we added the BookingRooms table, it might have fucked with the structure.
After testing, UserId was still there.
There was a navigation value in the User class that was not suppose to be there.

JWT tomfuckery: First of all, the code that Mathias gave out did not work, because he accidentally made two of the
same values, which turned the JWT values into arrays.
Then, because we said "app.Authentication" AFTER "app.Authorization," it did not work, because it is Authenticate,
AND THEN authorization. The program says fucking nothing about this btw.

If you change the roles authorization of a method, a hot reload is not enough.
