EditForm and validations require a Class and Properties, not fields. You can set a field to be a property by adding "{ get; set; }".

I accidentially wrote:
await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("alert" + msg);
Instead of:
await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("alert", msg);
The error message was confusing, so I had a lot of trouble with it.
