EditForm and validations require a Class and Properties, not fields. You can set a field to be a property by adding "{ get; set; }".

I accidentially wrote:
await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("alert" + msg);
Instead of:
await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("alert", msg);
The error message was confusing, so I had a lot of trouble with it.

Our JavaScript functions are loaded very inconsistently, and after multiple tests of moving them in and out of specific
files, I dont know what to do.
Edit: They are now back in the script.js file, which they were originally, but now they dont cause problems for some fucking reason.

Need to know how we should handle the JWT once it is on the local storage.
